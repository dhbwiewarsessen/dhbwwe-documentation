# Test plan

## 1.	Introduction
### 1.1	Purpose
- The purpose of the Iteration Test Plan is to gather all of the information necessary to plan and control the test effort for a given iteration. It describes the approach to testing the software, and is the top-level plan generated and used by managers to direct the test effort.

  This *Test Plan* for the DHBWieWarsEssen-App supports the following objectives:

  •           figure out if all functionalities work 

  •           find out if all wrong inputs are catched
### 1.2	Scope
Unit-Tests are planned to cover most of the Use-Cases for the front-end.
### 1.3	Intended Audience
The targeted Audience are Developers working on this Project.
### 1.4	Document Terminology and Acronyms
- **SRS**	Software Requirements Specification
- **n/a**	not applicable
- **tbd**	to be determined
### 1.5	 References
- n.a.

## 2.	Evaluation Mission and Test Motivation
### 2.1	Background
The main goal of testing is to be sure, that after small changes the functionalities will still work without problems.

Furthermore to find out where Bugs could possibly hide. 

### 2.2	Evaluation Mission
·        find as many bugs as possible

·        make sure everything works after changes

·        advise about testing

### 2.3	Test Motivators
The motivation for testing our App with Unit-Test is, that our App has the quality we imagined at the beginning. Another point is time, because it is much faster to test the App with Unit-Test rather then test everything yourself.

## 3.	Target Test Items
For testing we decided to test Use-Cases that are linked to the frontend.
